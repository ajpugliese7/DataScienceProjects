    "For this project we want to use a LSTM model in order to predict the type of product a consumer is complaining about.  We could do preliminary analysis on the complaints, but it seems from glossing over a few of the complaints that the tokenization of the consumer complaint text should be sufficient in order to classify most of the values to a given product.  Let's try this."
